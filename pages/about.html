<h1>About me</h1>

<p>I am an experienced data scientist, data engineer,
and software developer looking to continue my career in solving complex data
problems using programming, machine learning, and statistics.
</p>

<p>I have a proven record of work success in fast-paced R&amp;D environments.
A lot of my experience of working with data and programming comes from my PhD
work in particle physics at the Large Hadron Collider, where I developed and
implemented pipelines for data processing, machine learning, and statistical
analysis in C++ and Python.
I have more than 10 year of programming experience in these languages.
My research was on one of the flagship data analysis projects at CERN, and was
the measurement of the Higgs boson production cross section in the diphoton
decay channel

My PhD work also involved working with particle detector electronics,
as well as processing data from sensors and image-like data.
As part of the detector data analysis, I applied geometric clustering
algorithms.
</p>

<p>After defending my PhD in physics, I decided to pursue a career in data
science, because I felt that my passion lies closer to working with data and
developing software for that purpose. I have industry experience in data
science from working at Revelio Labs in 2022, where I worked on data-driven
models, which I engineered and optimized for both quality of predictions and
computation speed.
At Revelio Labs, I worked extensively with large SQL databases, specifically
using AWS and Snowflake.
</p>

<p>I have experience from both industry and academic settings
of working under stringent time constraints to meet project deadlines,
and also
of documenting my research and software.
I also have a passion for building software tools that can be applied to
recurring problems.
On a number of occasions, I developed tools, which I successfully shared with
colleagues, and which helped automate and speed up data analysis procedures and
pipelines.
</p>

<p>I'm excited about working on the challenging problems, requiring
experience and expertise in multiple areas to converge on a solution.
