<p class="ind">
Contributed to one of the highest-profile efforts at the Large Hadron Collider
at CERN to obtain precision measurements of the properties of the Higgs boson
discovered in 2012. In this series of analyses, we measured the Higgs boson
production cross sections in the diphoton decay channel. Differential and
fiducial cross sections were obtained from the signal yield, extracted via
regression analysis using empirical signal and background models. A combination
of Monte Carlo event simulations and data-driven techniques were used to
optimize the statistical models and to assess uncertainties.</p>

Contributed to FPGA firmware development and hardware radiation testing for the
Phase-II upgrades of the ATLAS Tile calorimeter.</p>

Analyzed effects of the finite mass of the top quark on the distributions of
observables in proton-proton collision events producing the Higgs boson in
association with hadronic jets using GoSam simulated events.</p>
