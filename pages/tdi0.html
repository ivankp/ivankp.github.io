<h1>The Data Incubator project proposal</h1>
<h2>Project description</h2>
<p>The recent decades have seen a rise in the popularity of board games, with
thousands of new games being developed and published every year. With some
games performing better on the market in terms of sparking public interest and
sales, both developers and publishers must be interested in quantifying the
characteristics that drive the demand, as well as how the relative importance
of these characteristics evolves over time.
The plots below demonstrate the large recent increase in the numbers of newly
produced games.</p>

<p>As a board gaming enthusiast, I want to see the companies producing games
thrive. The financial success of the companies can allow them to lower the cost
of games, as well as to take risk with publishing more experimental games,
which promotes innovation in game design.</p>

<p>I propose conducting a study to analyze the trends of the board games
market. The central objective of this study is to identify metrics that can aid
in deciding how to prioritize the production of new games. The answer can be
found by analyzing correlations between the characteristics of the games and
several performance metrics.</p>

<p>The characteristics of the games can be categorical, such as game mechanics
and themes, or numerical, such as the number of components, expected playtime,
target player age, number of players, etc. Poll ratings and reviews can be used
as performance metrics.</p>

<p>A large data set including this information can be obtained from the popular
Board Game Geek (BGG) website
[<a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/">https://boardgamegeek.com/</a>].

<p>An additional characteristic of game <span class="bf">complexity</span>
can be estimated by applying
<span class="bf">natural language processing</span>
techniques to the text of the rules of the games.</p>

<p>Additional performance metrics can also be found. For example,
<span class="bf">popularity</span>
can be assessed based on Google search statistics
[<a href="https://trends.google.com/">https://trends.google.com/</a>].
<span class="bf">Sales</span> performance can be obtained by scraping Amazon.</p>

<p>A number of meta-characteristics can be derived.
A <span class="bf">principal component analysis</span> (PCA)
can be performed to identify the most descriptive linear combinations within
the space of available characteristics.
A <span class="bf">multivariate model</span>,
e.g. a <span class="bf">neural network</span>,
can be trained to predict the expected game rating, which may quantify
the expected overall reception of the game.</p>

<p>Ultimately, a prediction of the game performance can be quantified by the
model-estimated rating and the trends in the principal characteristics.</p>

<h2>Technical details and challenges</h2>

<p>A 1,229 MB dataset, representing 313,248 games, can be assembled using the
BGG XML API
[<a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_API">https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_API</a>].
To do this, I wrote a <span class="tt">bash</span> script
[<a href="https://github.com/ivankp/tdi_capstone/blob/0/scrape.sh">link</a>]
that iterated over the <span class="tt">gameid</span> numbers and downloaded
XML data in groups of 100 games using <span class="tt">curl</span>. I then
wrote a python script
[<a href="https://github.com/ivankp/tdi_capstone/blob/0/merge.py">link</a>]
that parsed the XML files and aggregated the most relevant information about
all the games in a single JSON file. The JSON file can be easily imported into
a Pandas DataFrame in python and examined visually in a Jupyter notebook
[<a href="https://github.com/ivankp/tdi_capstone/blob/0/pandas.ipynb">link</a>].</p>

<p>As I came up with the project while working on the TDI fellowship challenge,
the project is currently in the exploratory stage, in which the most relevant
information for the analysis will be identified.</p>

<p>A part of the initial stage is data cleaning. Some game entries in the BGG
dataset lack some information. For example, not all games have a list of the
mechanics they employ. As I expect the mechanics to be one of the central
characteristics, entries lacking this information can be filtered out. In
pandas this can be done as follows:</p>
<p><span class="tt">
df_clean = df[ df.apply(lambda row: len(row['mechanics']) &gt; 0, axis=1) ]
</span></p>

<p>The games that are too old, e.g. published before the advent of the
internet, may have different properties from the modern ones and may bias the
analysis if included. Therefore, I think is it necessary to include only the
games published after the year 2000. Fortunately, older games form only a
relatively small (12.5%) subset of the data.</p>

<p>After the data cleaning stage, the project can proceed as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Scrape historic search data for the selected games from Google.</li>
  <li>Scrape historic sales data for the selected games from Amazon.</li>
  <li>Scrape rulebooks to obtain a complexity measure for each game.</li>
  <li>Perform PCA to identify the most relevant game characteristics.
    This can be done using scikit-learn in python.</li>
  <li>Train a multivariate model to predict performance metrics from the
    characteristics.</li>
  <li>Explore trends in the desirability of characteristics quantified by the
    model as a function of time.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Preliminary plots</h2>
<h3>Common game mechanics</h3>
<img src="https://github.com/ivankp/tdi_capstone/raw/0/mech_freq.png" width="600">

<p>This plot shows a histogram identifying the 10 most commonly used game
mechanics. The horizontal axis shows the numbers of games making use of the
corresponding mechanics published between years 2000 and 2021 inclusively.<p>

<p>The plot shows that a few mechanics are very common and account for most games.
This is an example of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle" class="rm">
Pareto principle</a>.
This may simplify the PCA later on, as rare mechanics may not hold much
predictive power and may be discarded, reducing the dimensionality of the
problem.</p>

<h3>Average rating over time</h3>
<img src="https://github.com/ivankp/tdi_capstone/raw/0/mech_avg_rating.png" width="600">

<p>This plots shows the average BGG rating of games published between 2000 and
2021 categorized by the mechanics they make use of.</p>

<p>The plot indicates a number of effects.
The first one is that there appears to be a decrease in the rating (which is
likely to be correlated with popularity and sales) of the “Hand Management”
games in comparison to the “Variable Player Powers”, “Set Collection”, and
“Cooperative” games. While being the most utilized mechanics, “Dice Rolling”
score approximately the lowest independently of time.
</p>

<p>The second observation that can be made, is that there appears to be a
latency in acceptance of new games.
It is unlikely that in reality games published in 2010 were objectively better
than those from 2015 or 2020.
In fact, anyone following the developments in the field of board games would
conclude the opposite.
The most likely explanation for the increase of the average ratings towards
2010 and subsequent apparent decrease is that it takes time for people to
experience new games more fully, creating a latency of about 5 to 10 years in
rating polls.
Before conducting a multivariate analysis, an adjusted rating measure may be
created to account for this effect.</p>

<p>Potential outliers may still be present in the data set as suggested by the
peak in the average rating of cooperative games in 2011.
A closer look at the list of the games in that subset is need.</p>

<h3>Overlap between mechanics</h3>
<img src="https://github.com/ivankp/tdi_capstone/raw/0/mech_overlap.png" width="500">

<p>The matrix above shows in color the fractions of games with each mechanics
that make use of another mechanics for the 50 most common types of mechanics.
The numbers are normalized across every row by the total number of games
utilizing that mechanics.
The diagonal elements show fractions of the games listed in the data set as
making use of only 1 type of mechanics.</p>

<p>The presence of fairly large off-diagonal elements indicates correlation
between different types of mechanics. This is a good case for a PCA analysis
that would project out such correlations reducing the dimensionality of the
problem.</p>
