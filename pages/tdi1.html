<h1>The Data Incubator project proposal presentation</h1>
<h1>Analysis of trends in the board gaming industry</h1>

<h2>Project description</h2>
<p>The recent decades have seen a rise in the popularity of board games, with
thousands of new games being developed and published every year.
The drastic increase in the number of published games in the recent decades
is illustrated below.</p>

<p>As a board gaming enthusiast, I want to see the companies producing games
thrive. The financial success of the companies can allow them to lower the cost
of games or improve production quality, as well as to take risk with publishing
more experimental games, thus promoting innovation and diversity in game
design.</p>

<p>An analysis, such as the one proposed here, can help identify trends in the
market performance of games, characterized by design attributes and gameplay
mechanics.
A study of a number of performance metrics over time can provide a quantitative
understanding of trends, based on which a company can formulate
a strategy for the direction of board game design,
development, and production.</p>

<p>The objective of my analysis is to identify key metrics, which effectively
describe the game performance, and subsequently, to develop quantitative models
to predict these metrics from the game characteristics.
An important aspect of my analysis is description of performance over time,
which will allow me to capture rise or fall in demand for certain types of
games.</p>

<ul>
<li>Identified performance metrics:
<ol>
  <li>Game ratings from polls</li>
  <li>Quantity and quality of reviews</li>
  <li>Reported game ownership</li>
  <li>Numbers of game honors</li>
  <li>Numbers of mentions in gaming shows</li>
  <li>Historic search data from search engines</li>
  <li>Historic sales data from online stores</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Identified game characteristics:
<ol>
  <li>Gameplay mechanics</li>
  <li>Game design categories, i.e. themes, style, etc.</li>
  <li>Expected playtime</li>
  <li>Number of players</li>
  <li>Target player age</li>
  <li>Number of components</li>
  <li>Rules complexity</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<p>The final goal is to develop predictive multivariate models (neural
networks), capable of estimating expected performance metrics for a game
given its design characteristics.
The predicted performance summary can be used to make decisions regarding
production of newly designed games or allocation of efforts for development of
new games.</p>

<h2>The data</h2>
<p>A 1,229 MB dataset, representing 313,248 games, can be assembled using the
BGG XML API
[<a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_API">API</a>,
 <a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi/boardgame/217372?stats=1">sample</a>].
To collect this data, I wrote a <span class="tt">bash</span> script
[<a href="https://github.com/ivankp/tdi0/blob/0/scrape.sh">link</a>]
that downloaded the data in groups of 100 games
using <span class="tt">curl</span>.</p>
<p>To reduce the memory footprint of the data and to facilitate its exploration
using <span class="tt">pandas</span> in a <span class="tt">Jupyter</span>
notebook, I consolidated the data in a single <span class="tt">JSON</span>
file using a <span class="tt">python</span> script. At this stage, I retained
only the quantifiable data relevant for the analysis, such as game ratings,
poll results, game mechanics and categories, as well as other numeric
information such as playtime duration and the number of players.</p>
<p>In the next step, I performed data cleaning by retaining only the games with
the following properties:</p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="tt">year &ge; 2000</span><br>
  Removes games that are too old.
  Public perception of board games as a pass time has altered a lot in the
  last generation.
  Fig. 1 indicates that the explosion in the number of released games started
  around year 2000.</li>
  <li><span class="tt">year &le; 2021</span><br>
  Removes games that haven't been released yet, but are only anticipated.</li>
  <li><span class="tt">rating &gt; 0</span><br>
  Removes unrated games.</li>
  <!-- <li>Number of specified mechanics <span class="tt">&#38;gt; 0</span><br> -->
  <!-- Removes uncategorized games.</li> -->
</ul>
<p>I also consolidated synonymous attributes under common labels.</p>

<h2>Obtained results</h2>
<p>In order to gain familiarity with the data and reduce the initial scope of
study, I started the analysis by investigating dependence between the game
rating on BGG and the game attributes (mechanics and categories).</p>

  <figcaption>

    games in the cleaned BGG dataset.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The dataset provides two types of rating: a raw rating from polls and an
adjusted Bayes rating. The distribution of both ratings and the average as a
function of time are shown below. As the adjusted rating exhibits an artificial
decrease in rating of the most recent games, I decided to proceed with the raw
rating.</p>

  <figcaption>
    Rating distributions (left) and average rating over time (right) for the
    whole dataset.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Looking at the average rating over time of the games with some of the most
frequent attributes already reveals some interesting results.
For example,
movie and TV themed games have become competitively rated only after 2013,
abstract strategy games' rating has dropped below that of the other games since
2005,
team-based games have been about average until their rating rose in the
last two years, and
games with hexagonal grids have always been rated well above average.

<p>The BGG dataset contains games with 172 distinct mechanics and 84
distinct categories. It is also obvious by inspection, as well as from the
initial studies, that there is a substantial degree of correlation between
these attributes.</p>
<p>In order to investigate these correlations and to identify distinct groups
of games I performed a principal component analysis (PCA).</p>

  <img src="https://github.com/ivankp/tdi0/raw/main/fig/pca1.png" width="450">

    Left: Explained variance as a function of the number of retained dimensions.
    Right: 2D projection of the dataset.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The 2D projection clearly reveals a number of dense clusters.
Interestingly, these clusters are the most populated areas withing the
parameter space, but are not necessarily areas containing the highest rated
games. This alone already illustrates that the most common design strategies
often do not result in highly rated games.</p>

    green means lower.

</figure>

<p>To quickly explore these clusters, I identified 8 polygonal areas by hand,
and plotted the rating distributions of the games contained in them.
I also made a table of the most frequent attributes in each cluster.
This created a concise summary of the combinations of attributes ranked by the
typically rating they yield.</p>

<h2>Further development</h2>
<p>The next stage of the project is to train neural networks to create a
predictive model for the rating.
Once this is done for the rating, models for other performance metrics can be
trained.</p>

<p>Independent neural networks can be trained to predict different performance
parameters (rating, sales, searches).</p>

<p>Performance as a function of time can also be modeled, by either training
independent NNs on yearly subsets of data, or by training a single NN to
output estimated performance for a number of years.</p>

<p>The PCA can be used as an input to the NN models.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Even in the exploratory stage, the analysis has reveled a number of patterns
that can yield actionable conclusions.
These include:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Most games designed with certain specific, but very common, combinations
    of attributes are rated measurably lower on average than other ones.</li>
  <li>The average rating of games with hexagonal grids has always been
    higher.</li>
  <li>The average rating of abstract strategy games has been lower than that of
    other games since 2005.</li>
</ol>

<p>The richness of features of the explored dataset, significant correlations,
and statistically identified features of the parameter space suggest that
the problem has great potential to yield to more complicated multivariate
analysis techniques.
Incorporation of the remaining identified game characteristics and training of
neural network models will reveal the extent to which expected game rating
or any of the other identified metrics can be successfully predicted.</p>
