<p>I am a data science and programming expert by trade
and a high energy physicist by education,
with over 10 years of experience of analyzing experimental particle physics
data using advanced statistical techniques.</p>

<p>I defended my PhD in Physics at Michigan State University in December 2020.
I conducted my research on the ATLAS experiment on the Large Hadron Collider
at CERN.
My work focused on measurements of the Higgs boson production cross
sections in the diphoton decay channel.
I worked on the
<span class="nb"><span class="it">H</span> → <span class="it">γγ</span></span>
analysis throughout the Run 2 of the LHC,
directly contributing to 11 paper and conference notes.
My dissertation can be accessed from the CERN Document Server
